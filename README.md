# SpawnAuth

Authentication limbo and location restoration plugin

## » About

Keeps unauthenticated players away from the main world until they log in or register. Their original location is saved before they are moved to a waiting spot and restored after successful authentication.

Designed to replace the built-in spawn/limbo handling of authentication plugins, preventing issues such as players getting stuck at spawn, spawning in the wrong location after death, or other authentication-related edge cases.

It is recommended to disable the corresponding spawn/limbo features in your authentication plugin when using this plugin.

## » Supported Authentication Plugins

* **AuthMe**
* **nLogin**
* **OpeNLogin**
* **LoginSecurity**

At least one supported authentication plugin is required.

## » Features

* Saves and restores the player's original location
* Separate waiting spots for **login** and **registration**
* `vanilla`, `fixed`, and `disabled` waiting modes
* Works across overworld, nether, and end
* Optional automatic void world creation
* SQLite, MySQL, or in-memory storage
* Optional database cache
* Automatic in-memory fallback when the database is unavailable

## » Waiting Modes

### `vanilla`

Keeps the player near the server spawn in the overworld.

### `fixed`

Moves the player to a configured fixed location, typically in a dedicated void world.

### `disabled`

Does not move the player while they are unauthenticated.

After successful authentication, the player is always returned to the location they had before being moved.

## » Storage

SpawnAuth supports three storage modes:

* **SQLite** — local persistent storage
* **MySQL** — external persistent storage
* **Memory** — temporary in-memory storage only

The in-memory cache can also be enabled alongside a database. If the database becomes unavailable, SpawnAuth can fall back to the cache when `database.cache: true`; otherwise, persistence is disabled.

## » Notes

* The same configured world is used for all dimensions
* There is no separate configuration for overworld, nether, or end
* Disable the authentication plugin's built-in spawn/limbo handling when using SpawnAuth

Enjoy SpawnAuth!
